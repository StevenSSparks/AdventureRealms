# Adventure Realms - Terminal Window Management

## Current Status: Testing Auto-Close

We're working on making the Terminal window close automatically when you quit Adventure Realms.

## Current Versions:

### v1.1.0 (Latest)
- **New**: Self-closing Terminal window using background AppleScript
- **How it works**: After you quit the game, AppleScript attempts to close the window automatically
- **Fallback**: If auto-close fails, you'll see a brief message

### Backup Options (if auto-close doesn't work):

#### Option A: Manual Close Instructions
```bash
# Show clear instructions for users
echo "Adventure Realms has exited."
echo "To close this window: Press Cmd+W or click the red X"
```

#### Option B: Alternative Close Method
```bash
# Use different AppleScript approach
tell application "Terminal" to close window 1
```

#### Option C: User Setting
```bash
# Let users choose their preference
echo "Adventure Realms has exited."
echo "Configure Terminal > Preferences > Profiles > Shell > When shell exits: Close if shell exited cleanly"
```

## Next Steps:

1. **Test v1.1.0** - Check if the background AppleScript closes the window
2. **If it works** - Great! The user experience is seamless
3. **If it doesn't** - We'll implement Option A with clear user instructions

The important thing is that the app works perfectly - the Terminal management is just polish for the user experience!
